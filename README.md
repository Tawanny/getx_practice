# getx_practice

A GetX Flutter project.

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application with GetX.

In this project I am practicing implementing GetX as my state management tool. 
I am not only going to use GetX for state management but for all the features that it offers.
For example: [State management, dependency management, route management, storage and themes]
I am going to write as much notes as possible in this app.
